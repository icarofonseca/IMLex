**Introductory Machine Learning exercises**

Compilation of all the code developed for the homework assignments from the [Learning From Data (Introductory Machine Learning) course on edX](https://www.edx.org/course/learning-data-introductory-machine-caltechx-cs1156x).

The code was strictly developed to reach the homework answers which required computation, so it is not richly documented (or commented). Please consult it responsibly.
