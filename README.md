**Introductory Machine Learning exercises**

Compilation of all the code developed for the homework assignments from the [Learning From Data (Introductory Machine Learning) course](http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse).

The code was strictly developed to reach the homework answers which required computation, so it is not richly documented (or commented). Please consult it responsibly.
