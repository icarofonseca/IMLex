**Introductory Machine Learning exercises**

Collection of all code developed for homework assignments from the [Learning From Data (Introductory Machine Learning) course](http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse).

The code was strictly developed to reach homework answers which required computation, so it is not richly documented (or commented).
